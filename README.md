# ClawCode

> **Release 1.0** — Persistent agents for Claude Code with memory, dreaming, and heartbeats.

Claude Code is stateless by default. Every session starts from zero — no memory of who you are, what you talked about, or how the agent should behave. If you want a persistent AI agent that remembers, dreams, and has a personality, you need to build all of that yourself.

ClawCode is a plugin that turns Claude Code into a stateful agent. It gives Claude a persistent identity (name, personality, vibe), a searchable memory system with full-text search and temporal decay, nightly dreaming that consolidates important memories, and periodic heartbeats that keep the agent aware of what matters. Compatible with the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent format — import existing agents with one command.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+

## Quick Setup

**1. Create a folder for your agent.**

Each agent lives in its own folder. Create one and open Claude Code there:

```sh
mkdir ~/my-agent && cd ~/my-agent
claude
```

**2. Install the plugin.**

Inside Claude Code, add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add crisandrews/ClawCode
```

Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install agent@clawcode
```

When prompted for scope, select **"Install for you, in this repo only (local scope)"** — this keeps the agent isolated to this folder.

**3. Create your agent:**

```
/agent:create
```

This copies the template files and starts the bootstrap ritual — a casual conversation where the agent discovers its name, personality, and emoji. You can also import an existing OpenClaw agent instead:

```
/agent:import
```

**4. Reload to apply the personality:**

```
/mcp
```

The agent now wakes up with its identity on every session.

## Bootstrap ritual

When you create a new agent, a `BOOTSTRAP.md` acts as its birth certificate:

- Agent sees BOOTSTRAP.md and starts a casual conversation
- Together you discover the agent's name, personality, vibe, emoji
- Agent writes IDENTITY.md, USER.md, adjusts SOUL.md
- Offers to set up QMD for enhanced memory (if installed)
- Writes `agent-config.json` with memory settings
- Deletes BOOTSTRAP.md — the agent is born
- Runs `/mcp` to load its identity

One-time ritual. After that, the agent wakes up with its personality on every session.

### Configuring via tool

```
agent_config(action='get')                                    # View all settings
agent_config(action='set', key='memory.backend', value='qmd') # Enable QMD
agent_config(action='set', key='heartbeat.activeHours.start', value='09:00')
agent_config(action='set', key='memory.builtin.halfLifeDays', value='60')
```

After changes: `/mcp` to apply.

## Personality files

Every agent has these files in its root. Templates live in `templates/` and are copied on `/agent:create`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SOUL.md` | Core truths and boundaries — the agent's philosophy |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, emoji, vibe, birth date |
| `USER.md` | Your info, timezone, language, preferences |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operational protocols and behavioral rules |
| `TOOLS.md` | Platform-specific formatting notes (WhatsApp, Discord, etc.) |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Instructions for periodic checks |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | First-run ritual (deleted after onboarding) |

These files are injected as system instructions via MCP — every conversation gets the agent's personality automatically.

## Memory system

### Builtin (default)

- **SQLite + FTS5** — full-text search with BM25 ranking
- **Temporal decay** — dated files lose relevance over time (30-day half-life)
- **MMR** — diversity re-ranking to avoid redundant results
- **Chunking** — 400 tokens with 80 token overlap
- **Keyword extraction** — English + Spanish stop word filtering
- Works out of the box, no extra tools needed

### QMD (optional)

- **Local embeddings** via node-llama-cpp — no API keys needed
- **Semantic search** — finds related concepts, not just exact keywords
- **Three search modes:**
  - `search` — fast basic hybrid (vector + BM25)
  - `vsearch` — vector search with reranking (recommended)
  - `query` — full query expansion + rerank (slow, best quality)
- Install: `bun install -g qmd`
- Enable: `agent_config(action='set', key='memory.backend', value='qmd')`
- Falls back to builtin automatically if QMD fails

### Memory lifecycle

- **Daily logs** — Agent writes to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` during sessions (append-only)
- **Pre-compaction flush** — `PreCompact` hook saves info before context compression
- **Session summary** — `Stop` hook reminds agent to write summary before closing
- **Heartbeat** — Every 30 min, reviews daily files and consolidates into MEMORY.md
- **Dream tracking** — Every `memory_search` is recorded with concept tags and scores

## Dreaming

Nightly cron (3 AM) runs 3-phase memory consolidation:

**Light phase:**
- Ingests recent recall signals
- Deduplicates candidates
- Records reinforcement signals

**REM phase:**
- Extracts recurring themes from concept tags
- Identifies multi-day patterns
- Writes reflections to DREAMS.md

**Deep phase — ranks candidates with 6 weighted signals:**

| Signal | Weight | Measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Relevance | 0.30 | Average retrieval quality |
| Frequency | 0.24 | Times recalled |
| Query diversity | 0.15 | Distinct days searched |
| Recency | 0.15 | Freshness (7-day half-life) |
| Consolidation | 0.10 | Multi-day recurrence |
| Conceptual richness | 0.06 | Concept-tag density |

- Applies threshold gates (minScore, minRecallCount, minUniqueQueries)
- Rehydrates snippets from live files (skips stale/deleted entries)
- Checks for duplicates in MEMORY.md
- Promotes winners to `memory/MEMORY.md`
- Writes diary to `DREAMS.md`

Run manually: `dream(action='run')` or preview with `dream(action='dry-run')`.

## Hooks

| Hook | When | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | Shows identity, creates heartbeat + dreaming crons if missing |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compression | Reminds agent to save info to daily log |
| `Stop` | Agent about to stop | Reminds agent to write session summary |
| `SessionEnd` | Session closes | Logs event to dream tracking |

## Configuration

All settings in `agent-config.json` — edit directly or use the `agent_config` tool.

### Memory backend

```json
{ "memory": { "backend": "builtin" } }
{ "memory": { "backend": "qmd", "qmd": { "searchMode": "vsearch" } } }
```

### Heartbeat active hours

```json
{
  "heartbeat": {
    "schedule": "*/30 * * * *",
    "activeHours": { "start": "08:00", "end": "23:00", "timezone": "America/Santiago" }
  }
}
```

### Dreaming schedule

```json
{ "dreaming": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *", "timezone": "America/Santiago" } }
```

### Builtin search tuning

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "builtin": { "temporalDecay": true, "halfLifeDays": 30, "mmr": true, "mmrLambda": 0.7 }
  }
}
```

## Going further

### Importing from OpenClaw

**Agents** (`/agent:import`):
- Lists agents from `~/.openclaw/workspace*/`
- Copies bootstrap files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, etc.)
- Optionally imports memory (MEMORY.md + recent daily files)
- Adapts AGENTS.md for Claude Code (removes OpenClaw-specific tool references)
- Interactive skill import with 3-tier classification:
  - **GREEN** — importable as-is
  - **YELLOW** — needs adaptation (comments added for manual review)
  - **RED** — depends on OpenClaw infrastructure (skipped, documented in IMPORT_BACKLOG.md)
- Credentials are never copied

**Crons** (`/agent:crons`):
- Reads `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`
- Converts to Claude Code local scheduled tasks (CronCreate)
- Same 3-tier classification for each cron
- Cron expressions kept as-is (local timezone)
- Prompts adapted for Claude Code tools
- Delivery channels mapped to MCP tool instructions
- `durable: true` — persist across restarts (7-day expiration)
- Only run while Claude Code is open

### Messaging channels

Reach your agent from WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, or Slack. Run `/agent:messaging` to get guided setup, or install manually.

| Platform | Marketplace | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **WhatsApp** | `crisandrews/claude-whatsapp` | `/plugin install whatsapp@claude-whatsapp` |
| Telegram | `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` | `/plugin install telegram@claude-plugins-official` |
| Discord | `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` | `/plugin install discord@claude-plugins-official` |
| iMessage (macOS) | `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` | `/plugin install imessage@claude-plugins-official` |
| Slack | `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` | `/plugin install slack@claude-plugins-official` |

Each messaging plugin is an independent MCP server. ClawCode and any messaging plugin inject their instructions separately — no conflicts. When a message arrives:

1. Claude Code processes the turn with **both** sets of instructions active
2. The agent responds with **your personality** (from SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md)
3. The agent uses the messaging plugin's `reply` tool with the **correct formatting** for that platform
4. Anything worth remembering is saved to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — memory works identically across channels

**Quick start (WhatsApp):**

```
/plugin marketplace add crisandrews/claude-whatsapp
/plugin install whatsapp@claude-whatsapp
/exit
```

Relaunch with channels enabled:

```sh
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:whatsapp@claude-whatsapp
```

Then scan the QR code:

```
/whatsapp:configure
```

Now message your WhatsApp number from another phone — your agent responds with its personality.

### Multiple agents

Each agent = its own folder. Switch: `cd ~/other-agent && claude`.

### Always-on (run as a background service)

To keep your agent running permanently, wrap Claude Code with a process manager:

**macOS (launchd):**

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawcode-agent.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.clawcode-agent</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>claude</string>
        <string>--dangerously-skip-permissions</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USER/my-agent</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/clawcode-agent.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/clawcode-agent.err</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```sh
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawcode-agent.plist
```

**Linux (systemd):**

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/clawcode-agent.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ClawCode Agent (Claude Code)

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/YOUR_USER/my-agent
ExecStart=claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now clawcode-agent
```

## Differences from OpenClaw

| Feature | OpenClaw | ClawCode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | 24/7 gateway daemon | Per-session (Claude Code) |
| Multi-channel | Native | Via MCP plugins |
| Sub-agents | Persistent identity | Ephemeral |
| Heartbeats | Built-in 30min | Local cron 30min (auto-created) |
| Crons | Sub-second intervals | Local crons (durable, 7-day expiration) |
| Memory search | SQLite + FTS5 + embeddings | SQLite + FTS5 (+ QMD optional) |
| Dreaming | 3-phase | 3-phase |
| QMD | Built-in option | Optional via `agent_config` |
| Bootstrap | Conversational | Conversational |
| Config | `openclaw.json` | `agent-config.json` + `agent_config` tool |
| Voice/TTS | Built-in | Not included |

## Troubleshooting

- **Agent has no personality after setup** — Run `/mcp` to reload the MCP server. The personality is injected via system instructions on each session start.
- **Memory search returns nothing** — The SQLite index builds automatically on first search. If using QMD, check that `qmd` is installed and the backend is set: `agent_config(action='set', key='memory.backend', value='qmd')`.
- **Dreaming never runs** — Crons only run while Claude Code is open. Check with `dream(action='status')`. For manual consolidation: `dream(action='run')`.
- **Heartbeat runs outside active hours** — Set active hours: `agent_config(action='set', key='heartbeat.activeHours.start', value='08:00')`.
- **Import from OpenClaw fails** — Make sure `~/.openclaw/` exists and contains workspace directories. Run `/agent:import` for an interactive walkthrough.
- **BOOTSTRAP.md won't delete** — The agent deletes it at the end of the bootstrap ritual. If it persists, the ritual didn't complete — run through it again or delete manually.
