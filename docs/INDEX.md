# ClawCode Feature Documentation

Master index of every capability. The agent reads this first when it needs to recall how something works. Always keep entries in sync with the code.

## Core (always available)

| Feature | Doc | Commands | MCP tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| Memory system | _(retro-doc pending)_ | — | `memory_search`, `memory_get` |
| Dreaming | _(retro-doc pending)_ | `dream` tool | `dream` |
| Agent status | _(retro-doc pending)_ | `/agent:status`, `/status` | `agent_status` |
| Agent config | _(retro-doc pending)_ | `/agent:settings` | `agent_config` |
| Doctor | [doctor.md](doctor.md) | `/agent:doctor [--fix]` | `agent_doctor` |
| Skill manager | [skill-manager.md](skill-manager.md) | `/agent:skill install\|list\|remove` | `skill_install`, `skill_list`, `skill_remove` |

## Optional (user enables)

| Feature | Doc | Config key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP bridge | [http-bridge.md](http-bridge.md) | `http.enabled` | `false` | Local HTTP server for status, webhooks, skills |
| WebChat | [webchat.md](webchat.md) | `http.enabled` | `false` | Browser chat UI served by the HTTP bridge |
| QMD backend | _(retro-doc pending)_ | `memory.backend: "qmd"` | builtin | External semantic search via qmd |

## Rules for agents

- **Before using a feature you're unsure about, read its doc file in this folder.**
- **If a user asks "what can you do?", scan this INDEX** for current capabilities — don't invent features that aren't here.
- **If a feature is marked optional + disabled**, say so honestly rather than pretending it works.

## Rules for contributors

- Every feature change must update its doc in the **same commit** as the code.
- New features add an entry here before merging.
- Removed features delete their doc and remove the entry here.
- "_(retro-doc pending)_" markers are a to-do, not a permanent state.
