# ClawCode Feature Documentation

Master index of every capability. The agent reads this first when it needs to recall how something works. Always keep entries in sync with the code.

## Rules for agents

- **Before using a feature you're unsure about, read its doc file in this folder.**
- **If a user asks "what can you do?", scan this INDEX** for current capabilities — don't invent features that aren't here.
- **If a feature is marked optional + disabled**, say so honestly rather than pretending it works.

## Rules for contributors

- Every feature change must update its doc in the **same commit** as the code.
- New features add an entry here before merging.
- Removed features delete their doc and remove the entry here.
- "_(retro-doc pending)_" markers are a to-do, not a permanent state.
