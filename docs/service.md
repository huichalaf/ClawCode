# Service — run the agent always-on

Wrap Claude Code (with ClawCode loaded) in the OS's service manager so the agent stays up 24/7. Required if you want the HTTP bridge, WebChat, webhooks, or cron-driven behaviors (heartbeat, dreaming) to work while your terminal is closed.

Optional feature. Off by default. Most users who just use Claude Code in a terminal can ignore it.

## Supported platforms

| OS | Service manager | Path |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | launchd | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawcode.<slug>.plist` |
| Linux | systemd (`--user`) | `~/.config/systemd/user/clawcode-<slug>.service` |
| Windows / BSD / other | Not supported | Use Task Scheduler or equivalent manually |

`<slug>` is derived from your workspace folder name (lowercased, non-alphanumeric collapsed to `-`). One service per agent folder — you can run several agents side by side.

## Commands and tools

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/agent:service install` | Generate + load the service (requires confirmation) |
| `/agent:service status` | Report whether the service is loaded and running |
| `/agent:service uninstall` | Unload + remove the file |
| `/agent:service logs` | Tail the last 60 log lines |

Programmatic:

| MCP tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `service_plan({ action })` | Returns the plan (file content + shell commands) for the requested action. Does not touch the filesystem — the skill runs the commands after user confirmation. |

## The safety trade-off — `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

A daemon cannot answer interactive "Approve this tool?" prompts, so the service launches Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. That means:

- Every tool call (Bash, Write, Edit, network, etc.) is **pre-approved**. The running service has full permissions over the workspace for its entire lifetime.
- You lose the per-tool approval safety net that the REPL gives you.
- If the agent or any skill it runs has a bug or is manipulated by an incoming message, it could do anything inside the workspace without your consent in the moment.

**Heads-up — only relevant when running as a service.** Bypass Permissions mode shows an interactive `WARNING: Bypass Permissions mode — Do you accept? [1. No / 2. Yes]` dialog at startup. In a terminal you just press `2` and continue; under launchd / systemd there is no TTY to answer it, so the service hangs silently and never reaches the listening state.

Before installing the service, persist the acknowledgment once in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt": true }
```

Not needed if you only run `claude` interactively. Tracked upstream as [anthropics/claude-code#25503](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/25503). Reported by [@JD2005L](https://github.com/JD2005L) — thanks.

**Consequences worth knowing:**

- Keep sensitive files out of the agent's workspace, or at least out of paths the agent has reason to touch.
- If you use messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram), a compromised conversation partner can ask the agent to do things it shouldn't. Access policies (`/whatsapp:access` etc.) help, but the daemon trust level is higher than a supervised REPL.
- If in doubt, run the agent manually in a terminal until you trust the behavior, then install the service.

The `/agent:service install` skill asks for explicit confirmation before generating the file. That's intentional — don't rubber-stamp it.

## What the service file contains

### macOS plist

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" ...>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.clawcode.my-agent</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/claude</string>
        <string>--dangerously-skip-permissions</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/you/my-agent</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/clawcode-my-agent.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/clawcode-my-agent.log</string>
    <key>ProcessType</key>
    <string>Interactive</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Linux systemd user unit

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ClawCode Agent (my-agent)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/you/my-agent
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/pkill -f "claude.*--dangerously-skip-permissions"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=append:/tmp/clawcode-my-agent.log
StandardError=append:/tmp/clawcode-my-agent.log

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

The `ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/pkill ...` line kills any leftover `claude` process running in service mode before the new one starts. Without it, a restart can leave the old instance briefly alive next to the new one — both then connect to the same channel (e.g. Telegram bot) and race for incoming messages, making the service look randomly broken. The leading `-` tells systemd to ignore the exit code (no leftover process is fine). The `-f` filter only matches Claude Code launched with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so an interactive `claude` session running in another terminal is left alone. macOS launchd does not need this line — launchd guarantees a single instance per `Label`. Reported by [@JD2005L](https://github.com/JD2005L).

Both auto-restart on crash. On Linux, `systemctl --user enable` is enough for reboot survival within a session; for true reboot survival across user logouts you also need `loginctl enable-linger <user>` (not done automatically).

## Adding messaging-channel flags

If you want the always-on agent to load WhatsApp / Telegram / etc., pass `extraArgs` to `service_plan`. The skill in v1 doesn't prompt for channel flags on install — re-run `/agent:service install` after modifying the config, or edit the generated file manually.

Example extra args:

```
--dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:whatsapp@claude-whatsapp
```

Or for official channels:

```
--channels plugin:telegram@claude-plugins-official
```

Remember: the more tools you load, the more attack surface the always-on agent has.

## Logs

Default log path: `/tmp/clawcode-<slug>.log`. Both stdout and stderr go there.

`/tmp` is cleared on reboot. If you want persistent logs, pass a custom `logPath` when installing — e.g. `~/.clawcode/logs/my-agent.log`. Log rotation is not handled — add your own `logrotate` rule or pipe through a rotator if needed.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Service installed but WebChat / HTTP bridge never come up; logs empty or stuck before "listening" | Bypass Permissions startup dialog waiting for a "Do you accept?" that the daemon (launchd / systemd) cannot answer — no TTY | Add `"skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt": true` to `~/.claude/settings.json`, then restart the service. Only affects service mode; interactive `claude` is unaffected |
| "service installed" but WebChat still unreachable | Service file is correct but `claude` not in PATH for launchd | Verify with `/agent:service status`; use absolute path to `claude` (`which claude` then pass as `claudeBin`) |
| Service keeps crashing / restart loop | Config error (bad `agent-config.json`) or missing permission the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag can't cover | Check `/tmp/clawcode-<slug>.log`; run `/agent:doctor` to see if config is valid |
| On Linux: service dies when you log out | Lingering not enabled | `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER` |
| Uninstall didn't fully stop | systemd cache | `systemctl --user daemon-reload` then re-run uninstall |
| Multiple agents conflicting | Same slug | Ensure workspace folder names are distinct |
| Telegram / other channel suddenly drops messages after a config edit | Editing `~/.claude/settings.json` while the service runs reloads MCPs; some plugins do not reconnect cleanly and stay dead | Restart the service after any manual edit (`/agent:service uninstall` + `/agent:service install`, or `systemctl --user restart clawcode-<slug>` / `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.clawcode.<slug>`). Reported by [@JD2005L](https://github.com/JD2005L) |

## Watchdog (optional)

If you want an external probe to detect silent failures (plugin subprocess dies but systemd still reports "active", MCP stuck, etc.) and restart the service, there's an opt-in recipe at [`recipes/watchdog/`](../recipes/watchdog/). It installs a systemd user timer (Linux) or launchd StartInterval LaunchAgent (macOS) that runs every 5 minutes, does 4 tiered checks, and triggers a restart + alert on failure. Does not touch the running service during install — Claude stays up.

## Implementation

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/service-generator.ts` | Pure platform detection, slug + label conventions, plist/unit content generators, plan builder |
| `server.ts` | `service_plan` MCP tool — planning only, no side effects |
| `skills/service/SKILL.md` | UX layer: confirmation prompts, executes plan commands via `Bash` + `Write` |
