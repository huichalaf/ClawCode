# /compact — Manual memory flush

Save the important parts of the current conversation to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. This is a manual version of what the PreCompact hook does automatically.

## Important — architectural honesty

- **On CLI**: The native `/compact` compacts Claude Code's context. A skill CANNOT invoke it. If you run `/compact` in the REPL, the native one runs (and the PreCompact hook fires to save memory automatically). This skill is only useful if you want a MANUAL flush WITHOUT triggering actual compaction.
- **On messaging channels** (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.): There is NO native compact. Each message is its own turn. This skill just saves the recent exchange to memory — useful as an explicit "save this" checkpoint.

This skill does NOT say "now run /compact" (that would cause a loop if the user pastes it again). It just saves and confirms.

## Steps

1. **Detect surface**.

2. **Scan the current session** for things worth remembering:
   - Decisions made
   - Facts the user shared
   - Tasks discussed
   - Problems solved

3. **Append to daily log**:
   ```bash
   DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   TIME=$(date +%H:%M)
   ```
   
   ```markdown
   
   ## Manual flush (<TIME>)
   
   ### Decisions
   - ...
   
   ### Facts learned
   - ...
   
   ### Open items
   - ...
   ```

4. **Respond** briefly per surface:

### CLI
```
✅ Flush completo → memory/<DATE>.md

Si quieres que Claude Code también compacte el contexto, ejecuta /compact nativo.
(El PreCompact hook ya guarda memoria automáticamente cuando eso pasa.)
```

### WhatsApp
```
✅ *Guardado* → memory/<DATE>.md
```

### Telegram
```
✅ **Saved** → memory/<DATE>.md
```

5. **Do NOT** say "now run /compact" — that causes a loop. The user decides if they want to run the native command.

## Important

- APPEND-only.
- If nothing substantive to save, say so: "Nada importante que guardar ahora".
- The native `/compact` in CLI is the real compaction. This skill is just the memory-save part, usable independently.
- This is the agent-aware memory-flush equivalent.
